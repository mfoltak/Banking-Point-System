# Credit Card Reward Points System

I developed a Credit Card Reward Points System, aiming to calculate monthly rewards points based on customers' purchases. 
The system applies various reward calculation rules to maximize points earned, considering different priorities and combinations of rules for each transaction.

The aim is to devise a rewards calculation system capable of determining the total monthly reward points earned by customers. 
Given that multiple reward points calculation rules may apply to a merchant's transaction(s), the system must maximize the calculated 
points for a merchant by considering different priorities or combinations of rules.

Rules:

Rule 1: Earn 500 points for every $75 spent at Sport Check, $25 at Tim Hortons, and $25 at Subway

Rule 2: Gain 300 points for every $75 spent at Sport Check and $25 at Tim Hortons

Rule 3: Obtain 200 points for every $75 spent at Sport Check

Rule 4: Receive 150 points for every $25 spent at Sport Check, $10 at Tim Hortons, and $10 at Subway

Rule 5: Acquire 75 points for every $25 spent at Sport Check and $10 at Tim Hortons

Rule 6: Attain 75 points for every $20 spent at Sport Check

Rule 7: Get 1 point for every $1 spent on all other purchases (including leftover amounts)
